### Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm re-tech. I've been dabbling with tech for about five years now, but I've never really sat down and built meaningful projects beyond school work. im-retech is a project of mine to get started.

Through this, I aim to

- ðŸŒ± Relearn tech, starting with the most basic tutorials
- ðŸ”­ Explore technologies I've previously avoided
- âš¡ Build actual projects to apply what I've learnt.

In essence, I want to end tutorial hell and relearn what it means to be a coder.
